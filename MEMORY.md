# Session Memory (Dec 8, 2025)

## Key requests
- User wants `runbook.md` for the AI and `MEMORY.md` to track sessions.
- User wants a single Senior Place listing shown to verify all fields (care types, pricing, description, featured image).

## Current state
- Scraper and importer have been updated previously to pull all Senior Place fields and map them into CSV/WordPress drafts.
- README already contains the operational runbook; `runbook.md` created as AI-focused quick guide.

## Outstanding actions
- Present a single scraped listing with full fields to the user (spot-check still pending).
- Continue respecting checkpoint/resume workflow and dashboard visibility requirements.
